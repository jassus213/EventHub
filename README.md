## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the SignalFlow, a powerful library for managing and
dispatching signals (events) within your .NET applications. This framework provides robust support for event-driven
architectures and seamless integration with Microsoft's Dependency Injection framework.

# <a id="overview"/> Overview

The SignalFlow simplifies the handling of signals within your application, allowing you to
decouple components and manage interactions in a more scalable and maintainable way. By leveraging this framework, you
can streamline the implementation of event-driven patterns and improve the overall architecture of your .NET projects.

# <a id="features"/> Key Features
* `Signal Registration`: Easily register and manage signals using intuitive APIs.
* `Dependency Injection Integration`: Seamlessly integrate with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for efficient service resolution and management.
* `Flexible Signal Management`: Leverage interfaces for signal registration, subscription, and firing.
* `Asynchronous Signal Handling`: Support for asynchronous signal handling using tasks.
* `Customizable Event Handling`: Implement custom logic for signal processing and handling.
